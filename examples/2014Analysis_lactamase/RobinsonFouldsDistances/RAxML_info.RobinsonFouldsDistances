RAxML computation of RF distances for all pairs of trees in a set of trees


RAxML was called as follows:

raxmlHPC-SSE3 -z /home/jbloom/phyloExpCM/examples/2014Analysis_lactamase/RobinsonFouldsDistances//concatenated_trees.newick -w /home/jbloom/phyloExpCM/examples/2014Analysis_lactamase/RobinsonFouldsDistances/ -f r -n RobinsonFouldsDistances -m GTRCAT 




Found 2 trees in File /home/jbloom/phyloExpCM/examples/2014Analysis_lactamase/RobinsonFouldsDistances//concatenated_trees.newick



Average relative RF in this set: 0.146341


Average relative WRF in this set: 0.000000


Average relative WRF2 in this set: 0.000000
